HTML-Element-Extended
---------------------

HTML-Element-Extended is a package of several enhanced HTML::Element
classes, most of which arose during the effort to implement an
HTML::Element based table class.

The modules are:
        HTML::ElementTable
        HTML::ElementSuper
        HTML::ElementGlob
        HTML::ElementRaw

The resulting functionality enables:
        tables
        element globs
        element coordinates
        content replacement
        content wrapping
        element cloning
        raw HTML string adoption

INSTALLATION

You install HTML-Element-Extended, as you would install any perl
library, by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DOCUMENTATION

POD style documentation is included with each module. This is normally
converted to a manual page and installed as part of the "make install"
process. You should also be able to use the 'perldoc' utility to extract
and read documentation from the module file directly. See Changes for
recent changes.

There should also be some examples on the web page mentioned below.
