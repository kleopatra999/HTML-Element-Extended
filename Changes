Revision history for Perl extension HTML-Element-Extended.

1.18  Thu Jun 10 12:35:20 EDT 2010
        - added push_attr() method
        - tweaked glob dispatch for attr()

1.17  Wed May  3 16:52:03 EDT 2006
        - new_from_tree() uses a better rasterizer now, properly
          handling even more tortuous span issues. Thanks to Roland
          Schar.
        - Fixed as_XML rendering Thanks to Roger Crew.

1.16  Sat Feb 25 12:41:57 EST 2006
        - Fixed new_from_tree() to handle (ignore) tbody, thead and
          tfoot tags. Otherwise rows were ignored.

1.15  Fri Feb 24 15:34:13 EST 2006
        - Fixed some scoping issues ('my' collisions)
        - Fixed some undef issues running under -w (thanks to Carl
          Franks)

1.14  Sun Dec 11 04:01:53 EST 2005
        - Revised new_from_tree() to properly handle row and column
          span issues. Thanks to Mark L. Lott for debugging and
          prodding.

1.13  Mon Mar 28 15:14:12 EST 2005
        - Fixed nasty content bug

1.12  Wed Mar  9 02:30:10 EST 2005
        - Added new_from_tree() constructor which takes an HTML::Element
          object based on a table tag and converts it into a cohesive
          HTML::ElementTable structure.

1.11  Tue Apr  2 08:37:42 CST 2002
        - Added some version dependencies on prereq modules
        - More -w cleanup (tie/ref dep)

1.10  Mon Jan  8 19:29:59 CST 2001
        - Maintenance release (-w cleanup)

1.09  Fri Nov 10 02:21:30 CST 2000
        - Various bugs and warnings fixed.

1.08  Tue May  2 15:03:15 CDT 2000
        - clone() bug fix regarding text vs ref on first node.
        - adapted glob class to use content_list() rather than content()

1.07  Wed Apr 26 11:37:11 CDT 2000
        - More stable content policing, used for both table integrity
          and masking; new content methods should automatically be safe.
        - Deprecated delete_attr(), since this can now be addressed via
          attr($attr, undef).
        - Syntactical cleanup, code fleecing. Inherited constructors
          will work.

1.06  Tue Jan 25 20:05:05 CST 2000
